# Calpulli
Calpulli is a blockchain-based sports technology company/project.

Calpulli comes from the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs, meaning a clan that constituted fundamental unity. “Communal House”

I chose Calpulli because my fundamental goal is to amplify the communal powers of sport through (blockchain) technology. 

Calpulli is an ‘all-in-one’ tech platform for sports teams that will include digital ticketing, digital moments, streaming, player stats, coaching reports, and scouting.

We want to use technology/blockchain to help sports teams transition into the 21st century by reducing costs to existing revenue streams and enabling the opening of new revenue streams that were previously inaccessible to smaller clubs and teams.

This can be through:
-streamlining ticket sales 
-connecting clubs to local sponsors
-the sale of tokenized clips, i.e. the game-winning goal of a playoff game can be sold as an NFT to fans, players can buy their own highlights, etc.
-valuable data on club supporters, views, team & player performance, ticket sales, & more.
-NIL launch platform, i.e. harnessing an athlete’s name, image and likeness in a web3 ecosystem
